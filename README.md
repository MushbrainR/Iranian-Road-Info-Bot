# Iranian Road Information Telegram Bot

This project provides real-time road condition updates for Iranian roads via a Telegram bot. It consists of two main components:
1. A **web scraper** that fetches road condition data from a public source.
2. A **Telegram bot** that delivers the scraped data to users.

## Features
